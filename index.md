Responsive pages are the future of the web. Many of the webpages you use every day are much more than static; they <span id="move">move</span>, change <span id="color">color</span>, and react to your <span id="input">input</span>.

The instructions Mother gives to Red-Cape are spoken in English.
> Stay on the path and don't run, or you might fall.

The instructions that tell a browser how a page should act are written in JavaScript.
```javascript
redcape.stayOnPath = true;
redcape.walk();
```
