> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the ~~book~~ *webpage* her sister was reading, but it had ~~no pictures or conversations~~ *nothing responsive* in it, "and what is the use of a ~~book~~ *webpage*," thought Alice "without ~~pictures or conversations~~ *anything responsive*?"

Alice makes a good point.

Responsive pages are the future of the web. Many of the webpages you use every day are much more than static; they move, change color, and react to your input.

The instructions that tell a cat (or Dinah, at least) how it should act are spoken in English.

The instructions that tell a browser how a page should act are written in *JavaScript*.
