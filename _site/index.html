  <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the <del>book</del> <em>webpage</em> her sister was reading, but it had <del>no pictures or conversations</del> <em>nothing responsive</em> in it, “and what is the use of a <del>book</del> <em>webpage</em>,” thought Alice “without <del>pictures or conversations</del> <em>anything responsive</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Alice makes a good point.</p>

<p>Responsive pages are the future of the web. Many of the webpages you use every day are much more than static; they move, change color, and react to your input.</p>

<p>The instructions that tell a cat (or Dinah, at least) how it should act are spoken in English.</p>

<p>The instructions that tell a browser how a page should act are written in <em>JavaScript</em>.</p>
